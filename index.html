<h3>
Welcome to Yu-Shiuan Li (李宇軒)'s Page.
</h3>

<p>This page is set up to record some notes of my personal interest.
</p>

  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aIh-6XW81ZNY7qZFyU9PQaHnmwcMn-N1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miscellaneous remarks and notes during my leisure time</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Topics which I found interesting, including adaptive filters, ADC, RF design, device physics, etc.</li>
    <li>Last updated: 2024/04/12.</li>

  <li>Y.-S. Li and K.-C. Chen, “Partition and Identification of Cluster Number in Data Analysis,”  in Proc. ACM ICUIMC 2011. [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C2xGw2cG7ovuunbxBI_OIUS5ux7KtktA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf</a>]</li>

</ul>

<p>Other hobbies include <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/57997216@N05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photography</a>, hiking, yoga, tasting food, etc.</p>
<p>In recent years, one of my interests is to improve health with more experiments. There may be several different and even contradictory approaches for similar goals in body building. It’s interesting to explore the subtleties and find the way out. Those experiences invoke my curiosity in chemistry, biology, etc. unexpectedly.
